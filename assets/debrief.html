       The study aimed to see if the inverse base-rate effect was present in this
       simple experiment.
       Using the previous work of Kruschke (1996) and Lamberts & Kent (2007),
       we hypothesise that the inverse base rate will be evident despite the 
       reduced complexity of the task.
