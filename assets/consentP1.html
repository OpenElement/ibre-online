      In this online study you will be asked to go through two phases: one
      learning phase and one testing phase. In the learning phase you will be
      shown some mild symptoms presented as text, e.g. “tiredness”, and then
      sort these symptoms into their respective diseases, which are completely
      fictional.  During this phase, you will also be provided feedback on your
      accuracy.  After a certain number of correct trials are done, you will
      move on to the testing phase. In the testing phase, you will be asked to
      sort symptoms into diseases without corrective feedback.
      Your camera will be used to track your eye movements during the
      study. There will not be any video or audio recording of you.
